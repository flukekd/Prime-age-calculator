# Prime Age Calculator

This program calculates the year of the next prime age based on a given birth year.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the code file `main.py` to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code file is located.

3. Run the following command to execute the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


4. Enter the birth year when prompted in the format "YYYY" (e.g., 1990) and press Enter.

5. The program will calculate the current age and find the next prime age after that. It will then display the sum of the birth year and the next prime age.

**Note:** If a negative age is entered, an error message will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter a `ValueError` stating "Please input the right format," make sure you enter a valid integer for the birth year and try again.
